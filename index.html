<p>Occupied Paris was founded into the ROBLOX World War Two community under the German Forces as a location for German occupation. The German Forces has no inferiority complex, etc, we merely exist for World War II roleplay. Under new leadership, we will remain active, and have our full launch by the end of Christmas. The Wehrmacht, as well as other groups are being remade since the termination of netnix's ROBLOX account. We hope all of those in the German Forces and Occupied Paris groups ar epatient, and to get ready for Mayoral elections, etc.</font></p>
